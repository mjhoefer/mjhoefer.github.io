Welcome
======
My name is Michael, I'm a [computer science](https://www.colorado.edu/cs/) and [cognitive science](https://www.colorado.edu/ics/) PhD student at CU Boulder. I have a broad interest in complex systems, and in particular, social systems. My goal is to learn how to evolve societies such that they will be able to solve their most challenging problems, such as income inequality, environmental degradation, and war. I'm curently focused on human centered computing approaches to problem solving, and work in the [TMI Lab](https://tmilab.colorado.edu/) with a wonderful team led by [Professor Stephen Voida](https://stephen.voida.com/).

Research Interests
======
- Problem solving and measurement in social systems
- Systematic assessment of human need and satisfaction
- Personal, interpersonal, and community informatics
- Technologies for supporting serious mental illness, especially bipolar disorder and PTSD
- Dream science and technology for supporting dream engagement
- Meta-science and the quantification of scientific contribution
- Emotional technologies and processes for emotional education
- Organizational culture and intra-organizational mobility

As evidenced by the diversity of research interests above, I'm currently exploring a variety of approaches to problem solving in social systems. I'm most inspired by the ongoing work of [Jack Harich](https://thwink.org/sustain/work/bios/jack_harich/index.htm) at [thwink.org](https://thwink.org/) as well as that of [Joe Edelman](https://nxhx.org/) at [Human Systems](https://human-systems.org/). 


Methodological Interests
======
- Natural Language Processing
- Human Centered Computering / Human Computer Interaction
- Network Science
- System Dynamics Modeling
- Data Science and Computational Social Science
