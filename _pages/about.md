Welcome
======
I am an Assistant Professor of [Computer and Information Sciences](https://cas.stthomas.edu/departments/areas-of-study/computer-information-sciences/) at [The University of St. Thomas](https://www.stthomas.edu/) in St. Paul, Minnesota. 

Previously, I finished a dual PhD in [computer science](https://www.colorado.edu/cs/) and [cognitive science](https://www.colorado.edu/ics/) at CU Boulder, and worked in the [TMI lab](https://tmilab.colorado.edu/) advised by [Professor Stephen Voida](https://stephen.voida.com/). 

My research focus is in human-computer interaction and human-AI interaction, and in particular, personal informatics. I design, build, deploy, and evaluate reflective personal informatics systems that support meaningful reflection, in domains ranging from health and mood, dreams, time-use, needs, values, and virtues. I am particularly interested in studying how technology can support (and not hinder) personal development. I am also a founding member of the SPIRITED Collective, a research collaborative working at the intersection of design, technology, and spirituality/religion. 

In a former life I worked as an industrial engineer for Boeing and completed a masters in industrial engineering using AI for manufacturing and mechanical design.
