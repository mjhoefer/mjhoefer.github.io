Welcome
======
My name is Michael, I'm a computer science PhD student at CU Boulder. I have a broad interest in complex systems, and in particular, social systems. My goal is to learn how to evolve societies such that they will be able to solve their most challenging problems, such as income inequality, environmental degradation, and war. My overarching goal is to improve opportunities for life on earth, through increased political, environmental, and economic sustainability.
