Representing Individual Motivations for Economic Activity
======

This project is all about answering the question "why do individuals engage in economic activity?" at arbitrary scales of social organization. I believe this is a missing link in our understanding of people and economies. The classical assumption of a utility maximizing rational consumer is flawed. I'm building a system that will help support reflection at various levels of social organization, starting at the individual and allowing for aggregation at any arbitrary scale. Hopefully this system will serve as a tool to guide the actions of our largest organizations - even if only for having a reliable way to know how the people are doing, in detail, directly from the people. 

The methodological approaches in this project are:

- Representing an individual as a network, not a number
- Sharing nodes in a bipartite network as a way of ensuring similarity across networks
- Aggregating networks in various ways using methods from multilayer networks
- Structured reflection across developed theories of need/well-being/motivation to generate a new kind of datasource - structured representations of a life

Publications and Presentations for this Project
- Poster at IC2S2 2020 (Networks for Understanding Human Need)
- Talk at Networks 2021 (The Individual as Network: Multilayer Intraindividual Ego Networks)
- Lightning Talk (upcoming) at the viz4good workshop (Representing Systems of Need and Satisfaction)

Current Status:
- Prototype software is still available at resatisfy.us. This project is the focus of my prelim exam, so I'm concurrently writing the code for the survey tool alongside the research.
- Seeking developer volunteers (please contact me via email)


Co-Tracking to Direct Attention in Interpersonal Perception
=====

Co-tracking is when you not only track your own mood, for example, but also your perception of someone else's mood. I'm currently developing a research plan to explore the use of co-tracking technology in close relationships. Will be recruiting participants within the next few months. 

I learned how to make a serverless backend in AWS for this project. I learned scalable database design in DynamoDB, easy identity management with Cognito, and some basic javascript lambda functions called directly from the React App. This app could live on the AWS free tier indefinitely, and scale to many many users with a bit of money.

I worked with a team of undergraduate and masters students on the app. They did a lot more of the front-end work. I did a bit of information visualization design, focusing on visualizing uncertainty from multiple data sources. 


Personal Dream Informatics
======

I conducted a large scale (N=283) mixed-methods survey with a targeted audience of lucid dreamers and dream trackers, to develop a better understanding of how dreams influence ourselves, and the technology that mediates it (largely dream journals and social dreaming practices).

Out of this study came the idea for "self-information systems" as an appropriate scope of analysis for individual level behavior change. I was excited to use a system dynamics style model to summarize the findings. Currently under review.

The Multiplicative Patient
======
I interviewed 17 clinicians to get their feedback on a variety of novel social interfaces for supporting self-tracking in the context of managing bipolar disorder. 

Interesting findings:

- Out of this project came the idea of designing different roles for different "parts" of the self
- Social reactivity - when social perceptions affect data measurement (eg - if I record this fight with my brother, my mom will see it, so I'm not going to do that)
- Suicide risk drives reluctance to integrate mental health data with clinician practices
