From Personal to Societal Informatics: Measuring Well-Being at Arbitrary Scales of Social Organization
======

My dissertation work is exploring new social measurements for guiding both individual behavior change and public policy. Traditional economic measures like per-capita income and GDP have become de-coupled. More money is not necessarily making us more satisfied. Human centered measured like gross national happiness (GNH) and the human development index (HDI) seek to better represent the human experience, but struggle to represent individuals (and entire societies) as single numbers.

My approach is to use a network representation of an individual to capture relationships between basic human needs, and the ways in which those needs are satisfied (satisfiers). A bipartite network, with shared need nodes, enables aggregation of networks representing individuals into multi-layer networks representing groups of people at arbitrary scales. 

The methodological approaches in this project are:

- Representing an individual as a network, not a number
- Sharing nodes in a bipartite network as a way of ensuring similarity across networks
- Aggregating networks in various ways using methods from multilayer networks
- Structured reflection across developed theories of need/well-being/motivation to generate a new kind of datasource - structured representations of a life

Publications and Presentations for this Project

Current Status:
- Prototype software is still available at [resatisfy.us](resatisfy.us). This project is the focus of my prelim exam, so I'm concurrently writing the code for the survey tool alongside the research.
- Seeking developer volunteers (please contact me via email)


Co-Tracking to Direct Attention in Interpersonal Perception
=====

Co-tracking is when you not only track your own mood, for example, but also your perception of someone else's mood. I'm currently developing a research plan to explore the use of co-tracking technology in close relationships. Will be recruiting participants within the next few months. 

I learned how to make a serverless backend in AWS for this project. I learned scalable database design in DynamoDB, easy identity management with Cognito, and some basic javascript lambda functions called directly from the React App. This app could live on the AWS free tier indefinitely, and scale to many many users with a bit of money.

I worked with a team of undergraduate and masters students on the app. They did a lot more of the front-end work. I did a bit of information visualization design, focusing on visualizing uncertainty from multiple data sources. 


Personal Dream Informatics
======

I conducted a large scale (N=283) mixed-methods survey with a targeted audience of lucid dreamers and dream trackers, to develop a better understanding of how dreams influence ourselves, and the technology that mediates it (largely dream journals and social dreaming practices).

Out of this study came the idea for "self-information systems" as an appropriate scope of analysis for individual level behavior change. I was excited to use a system dynamics style model to summarize the findings.

Currently under review.

Social Interfaces for Self-Tracking in Bipolar Disorder
======
I interviewed 17 clinicians to get their feedback on a variety of novel social interfaces for supporting self-tracking in the context of managing bipolar disorder. 

![Network representation of users and tasks](/files/bd_network.png)

Interesting findings:

- Out of this project came the idea of designing different roles for different "parts" of the self (intra-individual roles)
- Social reactivity - when social perceptions affect data measurement (eg - if I record this fight with my brother, my mom will see it, so I'm not going to track accurately)
- Suicide risk drives reluctance to integrate mental health data with clinician practices
